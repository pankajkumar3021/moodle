# cbse_govt_exam_master_structure.csv Generator

## Overview

This Python script auto-generates a comprehensive CSV file (`cbse_govt_exam_master_structure.csv`) containing the full hierarchical structure for:

- **CBSE Classes 6–12** (all major subjects and NCERT chapters)
- **Government Exams** (SSC, Banking, Railways, Civil Services, Teaching) with key sections and topics

Each entry includes:
- **Category** (e.g., CBSE Class 6, SSC)
- **Course** (e.g., Class 6 Science, SSC Quantitative Aptitude)
- **Chapter/Topic** (e.g., Food: Where Does It Come From?)
- **Section** (e.g., Quiz, Key Concepts and Theory, Exam Prep, etc.)

This CSV serves as a master template for curriculum planning, content structuring, or as the basis for a content repository.

---

## How It Works

- The script defines two main dictionaries:
  - `cbse_syllabus`: all classes, subjects, and their chapters
  - `govt_exams`: exam categories, courses/sections, and topics
- It defines a list of standard sections per chapter/topic.
- It loops through every combination, writing a CSV row for each.

---

## How to Run

### 1. Requirements
- Python 3.x

### 2. Steps
- Download or copy the Python script (e.g., `generate_structure.py`) to your preferred directory.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the script’s directory.
- Run:

  ```sh
  python generate_structure.py
  ```

- On completion, a CSV file named `cbse_govt_exam_master_structure.csv` will be present in the same directory.

### 3. Output
- CSV with columns:  
  `Category, Course, Chapter, Section`
- Each line represents a section of a chapter in a course under a category  
  (e.g., `CBSE Class 10, Class 10 Science, Chemical Reactions and Equations, Quiz`)

## Customization: Adding New Courses and Chapters

### 1. Adding CBSE Subjects/Chapters

Edit the `cbse_syllabus` dictionary in the script:

```python
cbse_syllabus = {
    "Class 6": {
        "Science": [
            "Food: Where Does It Come From?",
            "Components of Food",
            # Add more chapters as needed
        ],
        "Maths": [
            "Knowing Our Numbers",
            # Add chapters here
        ],
        # Add more subjects for Class 6 if needed
    },
    "Class 7": {
        # Add subjects and chapters
    },
    # Continue for Classes 8–12
}
```

- **To add chapters:**  
  Insert the new chapter titles as strings in the subject’s list.
- **To add subjects:**  
  Add a new subject key (e.g., `"Computer Science"`) and its chapter list for the class.

### 2. Adding Government Exam Courses and Topics

Edit the `govt_exams` dictionary in the script:

```python
govt_exams = {
    "SSC": {
        "Quantitative Aptitude": [
            "Number System",
            # Add more topics
        ],
        # Add more sections (English, Reasoning, etc.)
    },
    # Add other exam categories (Banking, Railways, etc.)
}
```

- **To add courses/sections:**  
  Insert a new key-value pair for the exam.
- **To add topics/chapters:**  
  Extend the list with new topic strings.

### 3. Adding/Modifying Section Names

Edit the `sections` list at the top of the script:

```python
sections = [
    "Key Concepts and Theory",
    "Quiz",
    "Midterm Exam",
    # Add new section names here
]
```

## Examples

### Add a New Chapter to CBSE Subject

**Add the chapter `Atoms and Molecules` to Class 9 Science:**
```python
cbse_syllabus["Class 9"]["Science"].append("Atoms and Molecules")
```

### Add a New Government Exam Category

**Add a new exam `"Defence"` with topics:**
```python
govt_exams["Defence"] = {
    "General Knowledge": ["History", "Geography", "Polity"]
}
```

### Add a New Section Type

**Add a new section type `Video Explanation` to all chapters:**
```python
sections.append("Video Explanation")
```
